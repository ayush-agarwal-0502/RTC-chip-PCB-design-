# RTC-chip-PCB-design-

This repository contains my work on the PCB design of RTC (Real Time Clock ) Chip implemented on a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) . The PCB is designed using EagleCAD , a professional PCB design software . The RTC Circuit is implemented using 555 timer as astable multivibrator , along with flip flops used as frequency dividers for the generated clock signal . 

__Skills :__ PCB Designing , 555 timer , Circuit Simulation , Digital Electronics 

## Project Results :

The proteus simulation , schematic , board and gerber file have been uploaded to this repository . The images of the results are as follows :
